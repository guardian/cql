You'll need bun to work on this project. You can install it directly from https://bun.sh/, or install it via brew on MacOS:

```bash
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun
```

Once that's done, to install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run a development server locally:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To run the tests and optionally watch for changes:

```bash
bun run test --watch
```
